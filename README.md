**Project Description: College Basketball Ranking Analysis**

In this Google Data Analytics Capstone project, I utilized the skills acquired throughout the course to conduct a comprehensive analysis of college basketball rankings. The primary goal of the project was to explore the performance and consistency of college basketball teams based on their rankings over the last six years.

**Project Workflow:**

1. **Data Collection:** I initiated the project by utilizing Python's BeautifulSoup library to scrape college basketball ranking data from various sources. The scraped data included essential columns such as Rank, Team, Record, Points, Year, Wins (W), and Losses (L) for the top 25 ranked teams over the last six years.

2. **Data Cleaning:** After gathering the data, I employed Excel to clean and refine the dataset. This involved addressing data type issues, correcting column values, and adding a new column to represent the win percentage based on the number of wins and losses.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in R:** The cleaned dataset was imported into R Studio for exploratory data analysis. I utilized packages such as ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, cluster, and factoextra to derive insights from the data.

4. **Analysis and Visualization:** I performed a variety of analyses to uncover trends and patterns. Some of the highlights include:
   - Identifying teams with the highest win percentages and their appearances in the top 25 rankings.
   - Analyzing teams' consistency metrics, such as the number of times they ranked in the top 10, top 5, and ranked first.
   - Plotting ranking trends over the years for individual teams using faceted line charts.
   - Calculating average ranks and identifying teams with consistently low rankings.
   - Applying clustering techniques to group teams based on their win percentages, wins, losses, and top 25 appearances.

5. **Insights and Applications:** The insights gained from the analyses provided valuable information for potential applications. For instance, the analysis of consistent top-performing teams could aid companies in targeting advertisements for games involving these teams. The clustering analysis could also contribute to strategic decisions related to team performance.

**Clustering Analysis Results:**

Cluster Explanation

It looks like you have posted the output of the clustering analysis, showing the teams that are assigned to each cluster. Each cluster contains a list of team names that are grouped together based on their performance metrics. Here's how you can interpret the clusters based on the provided output:

**Cluster 1:**
- This cluster includes teams with strong overall performance metrics.
- Teams in this cluster have high win percentages, indicating consistent success.
- Many teams in this cluster have made numerous top 25 appearances.
- Some of the notable teams in this cluster include Alabama, Arizona, Baylor, Illinois, Kansas State, North Carolina, Ohio State, and more.

**Cluster 2:**
- This cluster contains teams with a mix of performance metrics.
- Teams in this cluster may have slightly lower win percentages compared to Cluster 1.
- Some teams in this cluster have made a significant number of top 25 appearances.
- Prominent teams in this cluster include Auburn, Duke, Houston, Kansas, Michigan State, Villanova, Virginia, and others.

**Cluster 3:**
- This cluster consists of teams with varying performance levels.
- Teams in this cluster may have lower win percentages and fewer top 25 appearances.
- Some teams may have had fluctuations in their performance over the years.
- Teams in this cluster include BYU, Cincinnati, Clemson, Indiana, LSU, Seton Hall, UConn, Virginia Tech, and more.

**Project Outcomes and Impact:**

Through this project, I not only showcased my proficiency in web scraping, data cleaning, and exploratory data analysis but also demonstrated an ability to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. By combining Python's web scraping capabilities with R's powerful analytical libraries, I was able to create a comprehensive analysis that holds practical implications for sports marketing and management strategies.

This project highlights the potential for data analytics to offer actionable insights in various industries, including sports. It also underscores the significance of employing multiple programming languages and tools to extract the most value from data.
